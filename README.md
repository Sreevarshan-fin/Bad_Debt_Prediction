# Bad_Debt_Prediction

----

## **Problem Statement**

Businesses often sell products or services to customers who later fail to make payments, resulting in **bad debts** that negatively impact revenue, cash flow, and financial stability. Currently, there is **no predictive system** to assess a customer's creditworthiness or likelihood of default before approving a sale.

This project aims to build a **machine learning–based predictive model** that identifies customers who pose a high risk of turning into bad debt. By analyzing historical customer data, transaction history, payment behavior, and credit-related features, the system will help the business make **data-driven decisions**, reduce financial risk, and improve profitability.

## **Objectives**

1. **Analyze historical customer data** to identify key factors that contribute to bad debt.
2. **Preprocess and clean the dataset**, addressing missing values, outliers, and class imbalance.
3. **Build a predictive classification model** to determine whether a customer is likely to turn into bad debt.
4. **Compare multiple algorithms** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to choose the best-performing model.
5. **Integrate the model into a user-friendly interface** for internal teams to assess customers before approving sales.
6. **Deploy the system** on a scalable, secure cloud or web-based platform.
7. **Generate risk-based customer reports** to support decision-making and enhance transparency in credit evaluation.
